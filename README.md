# tech.debrief

math.debrief and cs.debrief are about the theoretical aspects of computing; related, usually more practice-orientated topics are dumped in tech.debrief.

It turns out difficult or impractical to cleanly separate strictly theoretical aspects of computer science from its practical side manifested in concrete software products; especially in lieu of general kernel theory and concrete Linux kernel.

Is there even a theoretical background to terminal, shell, CLI, and command line interface in general, quoth the raven. POSIX seems a good fit for providing a backing theory that many software projects endorse but invest substantial effort to keep on failling to implement adequately, completely or at all.

The Tech Debrief - practical aspects of CS along with other unfitting topics. "Practical aspects" as in theory rendered manifest through concrete software.
