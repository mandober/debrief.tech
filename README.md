## Theory and practice

**[CS Debrief](https://github.com/mandober/cs-debrief.git)** concerns itself with the theoretical aspect of computer science, particularly the theory behind the technologies touched on here.

On the other hand, **Tech Debrief** is about practical aspect of computer science, about the technology as reified theory, dealing with concrete, mostly software, products.

For example, *CS Debrief* examines the theory of programming languages (TPL), while *Tech Debrief* examines concrete programming languages i.e. TPL implementations.
