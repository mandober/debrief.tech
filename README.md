# Tech Debrief

- name: `debrief.tech`
- repo: https://github.com/mandober/debrief.tech.git
- desc: Techno notes concerning the actual products. The praxis.

An attempt at regrouping notes and cached thoughts about the concrete products spawned from mathematical and computational theoretical studies: descriptions of actual desktop and shell apps and utilities; concrete general-purpose and DSL programming languages; mentions of various technological end products. Briefly, the practical side of computing, the actual products made by applying the theories from mathematics and computer science. Actually, it's a bunch of excerpts, mostly scribbles, about apps, utilities, PLs, webdev and surrounding, preferably current, technology.
