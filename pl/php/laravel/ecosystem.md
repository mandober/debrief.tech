* Expressive, intuitive database ORM
* Database agnostic schema migrations
* Robust background job processing
* Real-time event broadcasting

## Laravel Excel
https://laravel-excel.maatwebsite.nl/

Laravel Excel is intended at being Laravel-flavoured `PhpSpreadsheet`: a simple, but elegant wrapper around `PhpSpreadsheet` with the goal of simplifying exports and imports. Export Blade views to Excel or CSV. Export queries with automatic chunking for better performance; exports can also be queued. Import workbooks and worksheets to Eloquent models with chunk reading and batch inserts. You can also queue every chunk of a file. Your entire import will happen in the background.
