# GNU/Linux distros :: GLOSSARY

## Rolling release
Rolling Release or Rolling Update is a software development model, an instance of the more general concept of *continuous delivery*. It is contrasted by Point Release development model which uses software versions where new versions the old ones. An example of this difference would be the multiple versions of Ubuntu vs the constantly updating (single) version of Arch. It's like ℤ vs ℝ.

## Point release
Standard Release or Point Release is a software development model based on discrete versioning, where a new version replaces the previous one. It is contrasted by rolling release model. It's like continuous vs discrete math.

## Linux Standard Base
Linux Standard Base (LSB) was a joint project by several Linux distributions to standardize the software system structure, including the FHS. The goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open standards to increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system even in binary form. LSB was essentially abandoned in 2015.
