Developed by the Debian Project established by Ian Murdock in August 1993

Debian is the basis for many other distributions, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali Linux, Tails, Proxmox, Pardus, Astra Linux.

Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel and, as of September 2023, the second oldest Linux distribution still in active development, only behind Slackware.

The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the *Debian Project Leader* and 3 foundational documents:
- the Debian Social Contract
- the Debian Constitution
- the Debian Free Software Guidelines

New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.
