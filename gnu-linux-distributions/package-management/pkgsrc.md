- BSD-like, Unix-like
- 22,000 packages


pkgsrc (package source) is a package management system that begun as a fork off the *FreeBSD ports collection* in 1997, and is now the primary package management system for NetBSD. Since then it has evolved independently; in 1999, support for Solaris was added, followed by support for other OSs.

pkgsrc currently contains over *22,000 packages* and includes most popular open-source software. It is the native package manager on NetBSD, SmartOS and MINIX 3, and is portable across 23 different OSs, including AIX, various BSD derivatives, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and QNX.

There are multiple ways to install programs using pkgsrc. The pkgsrc bootstrap contains a traditional ports collection that utilizes a series of makefiles to compile software from source. Another method is to install pre-built binary packages via the pkg_add and pkg_delete tools. A high-level utility named pkgin also exists, and is designed to automate the installation, removal, and update of binary packages in a manner similar to Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool.

Several vendors, including MNX.io, provide binary packages for popular OSs, including macOS and Linux.
