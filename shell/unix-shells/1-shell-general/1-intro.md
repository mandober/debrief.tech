A **command language** is a language for job control. It is a domain-specific and interpreted language. Common examples of a command language are shell or batch programming languages. Command languages can be used directly at the command line, but also to automate tasks that would normally be performed manually at the command line. They share this with scripting languages, though a command language is usually tightly coupled to the underlying system. Command languages often have simple grammar and their syntax uses English words in order to ease onboarding.
