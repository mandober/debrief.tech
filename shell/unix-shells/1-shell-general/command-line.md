# Command-line

1. command line interface to a computer
2. text-only interface to a computer
3. place on the screen designated for users to type commands
4. concrete text the user has submitted to the shell to interpret

"Drop to the command line" or "shell out" means using the command line interface to conduct a serious conversation with the computer. It's like when you call your kid by their full name, "Computer J. Hardware! You better listen to me now!". Command line means business so the computer is more likely to entertain your requests.
