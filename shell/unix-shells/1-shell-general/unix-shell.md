# Unix shell

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell

A Unix shell is a *command-line interpreter*, aka the shell, that provides a *command line interface* to a Unix-like operating system.

The shell is both an *interactive command language* and a *scripting language*, and it is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator; however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell are common for server systems. All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
