# Almquist shell

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell

The *Almquist shell* (aka *A Shell*, `ash`, and sometimes even `sh`) is a lightweight Unix shell originally written by Kenneth Almquist and released in 1989.

Initially a clone of the System V4's (SVR4) variant of the Bourne shell, it replaced the original Bourne shell in the BSD versions of Unix released in the early 1990s.
