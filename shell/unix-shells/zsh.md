Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor.

Of the standard shells, `zsh` most closely resembles `ksh` but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions, function autoloading, a history mechanism, and a host of other features.

- `zsh-doc` contains the documentation in GNU info and HTML formats
- `zsh-common` contains common zsh files shared by all architectures
