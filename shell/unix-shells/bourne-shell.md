# Bourne shell

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell

The Bourne shell (sh) is a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter and a scripting language developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs.

The Bourne shell was the *default shell* for Unix Version 7. Even if other shells are used by most users, Unix-like systems continue to have `/bin/sh`, which is either the Bourne shell proper or a link to a *compatible shell*.

Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, it was a replacement for the Thompson shell, whose executable file had the same name-sh. It was released in 1979 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs.

It gained popularity with the publication of The Unix Programming Environment by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike-the first commercially published book that presented the shell as a programming language in a tutorial form.
