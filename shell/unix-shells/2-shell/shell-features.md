Unix/Linux shells (unlike e.g. the cmd.exe on Windows) process the command line before forwarding the arguments (other words but the first) to the command (usually the first word on the command line). This process can be very complex and it includes the interpretation of *metacharacters* and many types of expansions.

- word-splitting
- quoting and escaping: removing quotes, escapes (backslash)
- globbing: expanding the glob patterns
- expanding tilde
- expanding vars
- expanding (calculating) arithemtical expressions
