# Command completion

The "t" in `tcsh` comes from the "T" in TENEX, an operating system which inspired Ken Greer at Carnegie Mellon University, the author of `tcsh`, with its command-completion feature.

Greer began working on his code to implement Tenex-style file name completion in September 1975, finally merging it into the C shell in December 1981. Mike Ellis at Fairchild A.I. Labs added command completion in September 1983. On October 3, 1983, Greer posted source to the net.sources newsgroup.
