## Progress vs Portability

Like the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of shell is based on gossip and controversy, and heavily opinionated by those who shout the loudest while holding a respectable position.

The central point of contention is the issue of portability vs progress, with conseratives pulling for the former, threatening discombobulation should their preaching fall upon deaf ears of the undecided hoi polloi. The opposing faction, the libertines, pull for progress with their vorsprung durch technik narrative, insisting on the use of modern backwards-incompatible constructs and things that would be called bashism.

There is no dearth of opportunities on StackOverflow for hardliners to voice their concerns - they knew it all along: now you've gone and done it, but alas, it may not be too late so listen carefully: do away with bashism before the clock strikes midnight or else. What one does in privacy of one's own shellâ€¦ matters; oh yes, it matters! It doesn't matter you only used it once in your private script - use bashisms once, you are bound to use them again, convict!

You done scared the chickens outta me, gov'nor! What we have here is a failure to communicate. You done raising me blood pressure, you did. Yeah, I done figured a way out. I done asked you for six months to chop that fricking Yeti, but you done spelled bashism wrong.
