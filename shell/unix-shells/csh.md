Hamilton C shell is a clone of the Unix C shell for Windows created by Nicole Hamilton, at Hamilton Laboratories, as a completely original work, not based on any prior code.

It was first released on OS/2 in Dec 1988, and on Windows NT in July 1992. The OS/2 version was discontinued in 2003, but the Windows version continues to be supported (hmm, latest release was in 2017).

Hamilton C shell differs from the Unix C shell in several respects, including the compiler architecture, use of threads, and the decision to follow Windows rather than Unix conventions (using drive letters like `C:`, dir separator is backslash, escape character is `^`, etc.).
