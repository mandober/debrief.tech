# Dead key

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key

A *dead key* does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after.

Dead key is mechanical in origin, and "dead" means without movement (of the carriage on a classical typewriter).

A dead key is different from a typical modifier key, in that rather than being pressed and held while another key is struck, the dead key is pressed and released before striking the key to be modified.

For example, pressing a designated dead key, followed by pressing `a` may produce `à`.

*Dead key mechanism* is intended for typing characters that lack representation on the keyboard, but the *compose key mechanism* is more comfortable; hitting a designated compose key, then `'`, then `a`, would give `à`; pressing `e` instead would give `è`. Most importantly, the user can define its own key compositions quickly by editing the `~/.xcompose` file.
