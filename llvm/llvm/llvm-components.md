LLVM components:
- llvm
- clang
- llc

The 3 most important tools in the LLVM infrastructure:
- clang
- opt
- llc

`clang` is the C front-end. `opt` is the middle-end, used to analyze and optimize programs in the LLVM intermediate representation. `llc` translates code in the LLVM IR into the assembly code of an architecture (x86, arm, mips, etc.).
