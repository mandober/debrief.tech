Commands for Changing Text
    
end-of-file (usually C-d)
The character indicating end-of-file as set, for example, by ``stty''. If this character is read when there are no characters on the line, and
point is at the beginning of the line, Readline interprets it as the end of input and returns EOF.
    
delete-char (C-d)
Delete the character at point. If this function is bound to the same character 
as the tty EOF character, as C-d commonly is, see above for the effects.
    
backward-delete-char (Rubout)
Delete the character behind the cursor. When given a numeric argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
    
forward-backward-delete-char
Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the end of the line, 
in which case the character behind the cursor is deleted.
    
quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)
Add the next character typed to the line verbatim. This is how to insert characters like C-q, for example.
    
tab-insert (C-v TAB)
Insert a tab character.
    
self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)
Insert the character typed.
    
transpose-chars (C-t)
Drag the character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as well. 
If point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the two characters before point. 
Negative arguments have no effect.
    
transpose-words (M-t)
Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point over that word as well. 
If point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
    
upcase-word (M-u)
Uppercase the current (or following) word. With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
    
downcase-word (M-l)
Lowercase the current (or following) word. With a negative argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
    
capitalize-word (M-c)
Capitalize the current (or following) word. With a negative argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
    
overwrite-mode
Toggle overwrite mode. With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode. With an explicit non-positive numeric argument,
switches to insert mode. This command affects only emacs mode; vi mode does overwrite differently. Each call to readline() starts in insert
mode. In overwrite mode, characters bound to self-insert replace the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right. Characters bound
to backward-delete-char replace the character before point with a space. By default, this command is unbound.
