# readline: Numeric Arguments

digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)
Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new argument. M-- starts a negative argument.

universal-argument
This is another way to specify an argument. If this command is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading minus sign, those 
digits define the argument.  If the command is followed by digits, executing universal-argument again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise
ignored. As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a character that is neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count for
the next command is multiplied by four. The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time makes the argument count
four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.
