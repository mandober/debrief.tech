# PECL

PECL (PHP Extension Community Library) is a repository of PHP extensions that are made available to you via the PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository) packaging system.

`PECL : PEAR = Composer : Packagist`


To be useful, a shared extension must be built, installed, and loaded. 

The methods described below provide you with various instructions on how to build and install the extensions, but they do not automatically load them. Extensions can be loaded by adding an extension directive to the `php.ini` file, or through the use of the `dl()` function.
