# Vim macros

- `.` repeats the last change, but it gets overwritten with new changes
- `q` allows you to record a macro (sequence of commands) and execute it later

You can make a macro recursive, add a count prefix, combine it with command-line mode commands, etc.

- q       Stop recording the macro
- qa      Start recording a macro in register 'a'
