# Visual modes

- visual mode `v`
- visual line mode `V`
- visual block mode `c-V`

Type a command to execute over the highlighted text.

`gv` in Normal mode will re-select the previous visual selection. Handy when performing a search-and-replace on a visual selection and you didn't match the substitution quite right on the first try.

- `[count]v` select chars on a line
- `v$` select all chars to EOL
