# Leader keys

*Compose key* (K) is set to any `Alt` key (either left `Alt` or `AltGr`).

A *leader key* is an additional prefix key, that comes after the initial Compose key, that triggers a particular layout.

A *layout* is a scheme, a way to produce symbols from a related set of glyphs.

A *collection* is an alphabet (greek, subscript latin, blackboard latin), or just about any set of loosely related glyphs, usually symbols related by a mathematical theory (set-theory, logic, arithmetic, relation-theory).

A *sequence* is the entire string of keys needed to be keyed-in to get the desired glyph. It always starts with the Compose key, and it usually ends with the base key. A sequence consists of all the prefix keys, plus the base key.

A *prefix key* is any sequence of introductory keys. Such sequences always starts with the Compose key, followed by one or more leader keys, before, finally, the base key is typed.

*Quasiprefix* arises when things become disorganized; e.g. `K .²` means Compose, dot, dot, to get `≥`. The <kbd>.∶¦•⁞⁝∘∙∷∥></kbd> key's other symbol is `>`, on which the resulting glyph is based)

A *base key* is the keyboard key corresponding to some degree to the glyph we want to produce. It is usually the last key in the entire sequence.

*Multiplicity* is the number of times a key should be typed. e.g. `K .²` means hit Compose, then dot, then dot again to get `≥`.


Key sequences
- prefix keys
  - Compose key
    - alt compose key
  - Leader key
    - more leader keys
- base key

Examples with multiplicities
- K \ a       `⋀`
- K .²        `≥`



Legend:
- type (hit) a key means press-and-release the key (opposed to hold)
- `K,g` or `K g` means hit Compose, then g
- `K,G` or `K G` or `K S-g` means hit Compose, then type G
- `K S-HOME` means hit Compose, then type Shift+HOME (rare)
- Shiffted key states are mostly implicit, e.g. `K R` = `K S-r`


Composed characters are entered by first hitting the Compose key, then a key. However, this way provides only a single "layout": if `K g` is used to get `γ` (and `K G` for `Γ`), what does one use to get superscipted, subscripted, italics, bold, italics-bold, fraktur, blackboard, and other numerous styles that involve `γ` and `Γ` letters? To get more layouts, we need plenty more "leader keys".




Additional ways to specify layouts:
- double-tap Compose as prefix
- double-tap Compose, then a KEY as prefix
- double-tap-key: e.g. `K n n` gives `ℕ`

My leader keys:
- comma
- period
- up
- down
- left
- right
- backslash
