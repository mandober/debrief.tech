# xcompose :: The compose system

The *compose system* enables writing various characters, typically outside the ASCII range and not available directly from the keyboard. Characters like accented letters, letters with diaresis, letters with misc decorations, letters from various languages and scripts, special punctuations, math symbols; in fact, the produced character can be anything at all, even multiple characters.

A *production* is the resulting character.
