## Spec Explorer
Spec Explorer is a model-based testing (MBT) tool that extends Visual Studio allowing you to model software behavior, analyze that behavior through graphical visualization, check your model, and generate standalone test code from your models. Behavior is modeled in 2 joined ways: by writing rule machines in C# (with dynamic data-defined state spaces) and by defining `Cord` script configurations, parameter values, and scenarios as action patterns in a regular-expression style.
