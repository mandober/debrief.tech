GNU is an extensive collection of free software (394 packages as of June 2024).

Despite its incredible architecture and the awe it inspires in us all as a singular achievement in the history of humankind, ask not what your kernel can do for youâ€¦ ahem, Linux the kernel is great but it would be nothing without a woman or a girl.

would not be very usable piece of software on its own. It had to be paired with a bunch of userland software so together they would become a fully fledged functioning (but not functional) operating system.

Without the GNU software, the Linux kernel would be unusable as a standalone component. Without the Linux kernel, the GNU software could still be used on UNIX-like OSs (or even on Windows). But together these two elements have made possible the myriad of GNU/Linux distributions.

A GNU/Linux distribution is a bona fide OS, although it seems improbable that only these two elements are sufficient for making an OS. Ok, so we also add *systemd*, X.org for GUI (more-less), what else? What are other necessary compoennts? Package manager probably. 

The GNU project was started with the idea to create a open-source UNIX alternative, that is, the entire OS. However, the development of the kernel turned out to be a tought job, so the GNU Hurd kernel was never completed. Once Linux came along and slipped into that role confortably, the GNU Hurd project was pushed further down the TODO lists.

Linux as kernel and GNU providing the crucial userland software makes for a complete and usable OS, therefore justifying the insistence on the GNU/Linux moniker.
