## GNU Hurd

GNU Hurd is a collection of microkernel servers written as part of the GNU project for the GNU Mach microkernel.

The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel. It is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).

GNU Hurd runs on 32-bit x86 machines. A version running on 64-bit x86
(x86_64) machines is in progress.

## GNU Hurd NG
https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/ng.html
Hurd-ng is an effort to build a new operating system that preserves the main design goals of the Hurd while fixing some of the Hurd's shortcomings. There is not yet an official roadmap or a concrete specification; indeed, much of the work is research oriented.

Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann wrote a paper titled A Critique of the GNU Hurd Multi-server Operating System. This was published in ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review in July 2007. This is sometimes referred to as the critique.

## GNU Mach
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mach

GNU Mach is a microkernel of the GNU project. GNU Mach is an implementation of the Mach microkernel. GNU Mach is the default microkernel in the GNU Hurd. GNU Mach runs on IA-32 machines. GNU Mach is maintained by developers on the GNU project.

## Mach
https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach.html

Mach is a kernel developed at CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) by Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian to support OS research, primarily distributed and parallel computing. Mach is often considered one of the earliest examples of a microkernel. However, not all versions of Mach are microkernels. Mach's derivatives are the basis of the operating system kernel in GNU Hurd and of Apple's XNU kernel used in macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and watchOS.


## Mig

## GNU MIG

GNU MIG is the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 interface generator MIG, as maintained by the GNU Hurd developers for the GNU project.
