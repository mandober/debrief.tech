# Anything but the kernel

One simply does not choose a kernel (for one's custom open source based operating system). One may pick a bootloader, a package manager, sure, a service manager even, but one does not get to pick a kernel. Linux is the only choice, which is somewhat strange for the open source community famous for frequent forking. Fortunatelly, Linux has no forks; possibly because it is too big and complex project, no one even dares thinking about forking. Curiously, GHC compiler is also an old and very complex project, but some heretics did dare to think to fork it, even to maintain a compatible alternative (!?). `Vim` have also been forked a few times, which eventually gave rise to `Neovim` that managed to flip a lot of users. However, Linux remains unshaken. Singular and constant. Linux always gets the part (and this year's monopoly on the OSS kernel market goes to… GNU Hurd! no, wait…). No other component comes near.

Among system managers, `Systemd` is nearly everywhere. `Grub` is a very popular bootloader (but using an indefinite article is a spoiler). Package managers are too histerical. The choice of desktop environments is rich. 

A choice between quality alternatives for any system component was always a given in the OS community, for anything but the kernel.

Having a choice was always at the forefront of OSS, with many components enjoying many hi-qy alternatives

for all components except the kernel, that is.
