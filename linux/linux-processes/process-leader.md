# Process leader

In the context of the *Linux Process Model*, a **process leader** refers to the first process in a *process group* (group of related processes group), which is responsible for managing the process group within the operating system's process management.

The process leader is the initial process of a process group that serves as the target for addressing the whole groups. It holds the group's identity and exerts some control over the group's behavior. Basically, Linux job control is more managable when related processes are grouped together, with the first preocess promoted to the leader position as soon as it spawns some child processes. This way, targeting the group by addressing its leader (probably) made some aspects of the pre-cretaceous art of job control easier.

* **Process Group ID (PGID):**   
The process leader is the process whose Process ID (PID) is the same as the Process Group ID (PGID). When a new process group is created, the process that starts the group becomes the process leader.

2. **Managing the Process Group:** The process leader is responsible for the creation of the process group and typically controls or influences the behavior of the other processes in the group. This is often relevant in job control scenarios, such as when a user sends signals to a group of processes (e.g., stopping or killing a group of processes).

3. **Termination of the Process Leader:** If the process leader terminates (exits), the PGID is not automatically destroyed, but the leadership of the process group may become less clear, as no new processes can join the group under the original leader.

4. **Job Control:** In Unix-like systems, when dealing with terminal-based job control, commands and processes are typically organized into groups, with the process leader acting as the main process for the job. This allows the system to send signals (like `SIGINT` or `SIGTSTP`) to the entire group, controlling the job's execution.
