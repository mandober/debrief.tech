# 50.5 Keeping Persistent Authentication Information

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Authentication.html

Some Emacs packages, which connect to other services, require authentication (Gnus or Tramp). Because it might be annoying to provide the same user name and password again and again, Emacs offers to keep this information persistent via the `auth-source` library.

By default, the authentication information is taken from the file `~/.authinfo` or `~/.authinfo.gpg` or `~/.netrc`. These files have a syntax similar to *netrc* files as known from the ftp program, like this:

    machine mymachine login myloginname password mypassword port myport

Similarly, the `auth-source` library supports multiple storage backend, currently either the classic *netrc* backend, JSON files, the Secret Service API, and pass, the standard unix password manager.

All these alternatives can be customized via the user option `auth-sources`, see Emacs `auth-source` in Emacs `auth-source`.

When a password is entered interactively, which is not found via the configured backend, some of the backends offer to save it persistently. This can be changed by customizing the user option `auth-source-save-behavior`.
