This chapter describes some simple methods to customize the behavior of Emacs.

Apart from the methods described here, see *X Options and Resources* for information about using X resources to customize Emacs, and see *Keyboard Macros* for information about recording and replaying keyboard macros. Making more far-reaching and open-ended changes involves writing Emacs Lisp code; see *Emacs Lisp*.

## 50.1 Easy Customization

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html

Emacs has many settings which you can change. Most settings are *customizable variables* aka *user options*.

There is a huge number of customizable variables, controlling numerous aspects of Emacs behavior; the variables documented in this manual are listed in *Variable Index*.

A separate class of settings are the *faces*, which determine the fonts, colors, and other attributes of text.

To browse and alter settings (both variables and faces), type `M-x customize`.

This creates a *customization buffer*, which lets you navigate through a logically organized list of settings, edit and set their values, and save them permanently.

## 50.1.1 Customization Groups

Customization settings are organized into *customization groups*. These groups are collected into bigger groups, all the way up to a *master group* called *Emacs*.

`M-x customize` creates a customization buffer that shows the top-level Emacs group.

The main part of this buffer shows the 'Emacs' customization group, which contains several other groups ('Editing', 'Convenience', etc.).

The state of the group indicates whether setting in that group has been edited, set, or saved.

## 50.1.2 Browsing and Searching for Settings

If you are interested in customizing a particular setting or customization group, you can go straight there with the commands `M-x customize-option`, `M-x customize-face`, or `M-x customize-group`.

Using the search only finds groups and settings that are loaded in the current Emacs session.

If you don't want customization buffers to show the search field, change the variable `custom-search-field` to nil.

The command `M-x customize-apropos` is similar to using the search field, except that it reads the search terms using the minibuffer.

`M-x customize-browse` is another way to browse the available settings. This command creates a special customization buffer, which shows only the names of groups and settings, in a structured layout.

You can show the contents of a group, in the same buffer, by invoking the '[+] button next to the group name. When the group contents are shown, the button changes to '[-]; invoking that hides the group contents again. 

Each group or setting in this buffer has a link which says [Group], [Option] or [Face]. Invoking this link creates an ordinary customization buffer showing just that group, option, or face; this is the way to change settings that you find with `M-x customize-browse`.

## 50.1.3 Changing a Variable

When showing a setting, the first line shows the variable's name, e.g. `kill-ring-max`, formatted as "Kill Ring Max" for easier viewing, and also shows its expected type: a positive integer or zero. The default value for this one is 120.

The line after the variable name indicates the customization state of the variable: in this example, *STANDARD* means you have not changed the variable, so its value is the default one.

The [State] button gives a menu of operations for customizing the variable.

Below the customization state is the documentation for the variable. This is the same documentation that would be shown by the `C-h v command`. 

Editing the value does not make it take effect right away. To do that, you must set the variable by activating the [State] button and choosing "Set for Current Session".

While editing certain kinds of values, such as file names, directory names, and Emacs command names, you can perform completion with `C-M-i` (widget-complete), or the equivalent keys `M-TAB` or `ESC TAB`. This behaves much like minibuffer completion.

Typing RET on an editable value field moves point forward to the next field or button, like TAB. You can thus type RET when you are finished editing a field, to move on to the next button or field. To insert a newline within an editable field, use C-o or C-q C-j.

Some variables have values with complex structure. For example, the value of minibuffer-frame-alist is an alist (association list).

When you set a variable, the new value takes effect only in the current Emacs session. To save the value for future sessions, use the [State] button and select the 'Save for Future Sessions' operation.

You can also *restore the variable* to its standard value by using the [State] button and selecting the *Erase Customization* operation. There are actually 4 reset operations:
- 'Undo Edits'    
  If you have *modified but not yet set the variable*, this restores the text in the customization buffer to match the actual value.
- 'Revert This Session's Customizations'   
  This *restores the value of variable to last saved value*, if there was one. Otherwise it restores the standard value. It updates the text accordingly.
- 'Erase Customization'   
  This sets the variable *to its standard value*. Any saved value that you have is also eliminated.
- 'Set to Backup Value'    
  This sets the variable to a *previous value that was set in the customization buffer in this session*. If you customize a variable and then reset it, which discards the customized value, you can get the discarded value back again with this operation.

Near the top of the customization buffer are two lines of buttons:

    Operate on all settings in this buffer:
    [Revert...] [Apply] [Apply and Save]

The [Revert...] drops a menu with the first 3 reset operations described above.

The [Apply] button applies the settings for the current session.

The [Apply_and_Save] button applies the settings and saves them for future sessions; this button does not appear if Emacs was started with the -q or -Q option.

The command C-c C-c (Custom-set) is equivalent to using the [Set_for_Current_Session] button.

The command C-x C-s (Custom-save) is like using the [Save_for_Future_Sessions] button.

The [Exit] button switches out of the customization buffer, and buries the buffer at the bottom of the buffer list. To make it kill the customization buffer instead, change the variable `custom-buffer-done-kill` to `t`.

## 50.1.4 Saving Customizations

In the customization buffer, you can save a customization setting by choosing the 'Save for Future Sessions' choice from its [State] button.

The `C-x C-s (Custom-save)` command, or the [Apply_and_Save] button at the top of the customization buffer, saves all applicable settings in the buffer.

Saving works by writing code to a file, usually your init file. Future Emacs sessions automatically read this file at startup, which sets up the customizations again.

You can choose *to save customizations somewhere other than your initialization file*.

To make this work, you must add a couple of lines of code to your init file, to set the variable `custom-file` to the name of the desired file, and to load that file. For example:

```lisp
(setq custom-file "~/.config/emacs-custom.el")
(load custom-file)
```

You can even specify different customization files for different Emacs versions, like this:

```lisp
(cond ((< emacs-major-version 28)
       ;; Emacs 27 customization.
      (setq custom-file "~/.config/custom-27.el"))
      ((and (= emacs-major-version 26)
        (< emacs-minor-version 3))
      ;; Emacs 26 customization, before version 26.3.
      (setq custom-file "~/.config/custom-26.el"))
      (t
      ;; Emacs version 28.1 or later.
      (setq custom-file "~/.config/emacs-custom.el")))

(load custom-file)
```

If Emacs was invoked with the -q or --no-init-file options (see Initial Options), it will not let you save your customizations in your initialization file. This is because saving customizations from such a session would wipe out all the other customizations you might have on your initialization file.

Any customizations you have not saved for future sessions will be lost when you terminate Emacs.

If you'd like to be prompted about unsaved customizations at termination time, add the following to your initialization file:

```lisp
(add-hook 'kill-emacs-query-functions
          'custom-prompt-customize-unsaved-options)
```

## 50.1.5 Customizing Faces

You can customize *faces*, which determine how Emacs displays different types of text. Customization groups can contain both variables and faces.

For example, in programming language modes, source code comments are shown with 'font-lock-comment-face'. In a customization buffer, that face appears like this, after you click on the '[Show All Attributes]' link:

```
[Hide] Font Lock Comment Face:[sample]
   [State] : STANDARD.
   Font Lock mode face used to highlight comments.
   [ ] Font Family: --
   [ ] Font Foundry: --
   [ ] Width: --
   [ ] Height: --
   [ ] Weight: --
   [ ] Slant: --
   [ ] Underline: --
   [ ] Overline: --
   [ ] Strike-through: --
   [ ] Box around text: --
   [ ] Inverse-video: --
   [X] Foreground: Firebrick     [Choose]  (sample)
   [ ] Background: --
   [ ] Stipple: --
   [ ] Inherit: --
   [Hide Unused Attributes]
```

The first three lines show the name, [State] button, and documentation for the face. Below that is a list of face attributes. In front of each attribute is a checkbox. A filled checkbox, '[X]', means that the face specifies a value for this attribute; an empty checkbox, '[ ]', means that the face does not specify any special value for the attribute. You can activate a checkbox to specify or unspecify its attribute.

A face does not have to specify every single attribute; in fact, most faces only specify a few attributes.

In the above example, font-lock-comment-face only specifies the foreground color. Any unspecified attribute is taken from the special face named `default`, whose attributes are all specified.

The *default face* is the face used to display any text that does not have an explicitly-assigned face; furthermore, its background color attribute serves as the background color of the frame.

The '[Hide Unused Attributes]' button, at the end of the attribute list, hides the unspecified attributes of the face. When attributes are being hidden, the button changes to '[Show All Attributes]', which reveals the entire attribute list. The customization buffer may start out with unspecified attributes hidden, to avoid cluttering the interface.

When an attribute is specified, you can change its value in the usual ways.

Foreground and background colors can be specified using either color names or RGB triplets. You can also use the '[Choose]' button to switch to a list of color names; select a color with RET in that buffer to put the color name in the value field.

Setting, saving and resetting a face work like the same operations for variables.

A face can specify different appearances for different types of displays. For example, a face can make text red on a color display, but use a bold font on a monochrome display. To specify multiple appearances for a face, select 'For All Kinds of Displays' in the menu you get from invoking '[State]'.

## 50.1.6 Customizing Specific Items

`M-x customize-option RET option RET`   
`M-x customize-variable RET option RET`   
Set up a customization buffer for just one user option, `option`.

`M-x customize-face RET face RET`   
Set up a customization buffer for just one face, `face`.

`M-x customize-icon RET face RET`   
Set up a customization buffer for just one icon, `icon`.

`M-x customize-group RET group RET`   
Set up a customization buffer for just one group, `group`.

`M-x customize-apropos RET regexp RET`   
Set up a customization buffer for all the settings and groups that match regexp.

`M-x customize-changed RET version RET`   
Set up a customization buffer with all the user options, faces and groups whose meaning has changed since (or been added after) Emacs version version.

`M-x customize-saved`   
Set up a customization buffer containing all settings that you have saved with customization buffers.

`M-x customize-unsaved`   
Set up a customization buffer containing all settings that you have set but not saved.

If you want to customize a particular user option, type `M-x customize-option`. This reads the variable name, and sets up the customization buffer with just that one user option. When entering the variable name into the minibuffer, completion is available, but only for the names of variables that have been loaded into Emacs.

Likewise, you can customize a specific face using `M-x customize-face`. You can set up a customization buffer for a specific customization group using `M-x customize-group`.

`M-x customize-apropos` prompts for a search term-either one or more words separated by spaces, or a regular expression-and sets up a customization buffer for all loaded settings and groups with matching names. This is like using the search field at the top of the customization buffer.

When you upgrade to a new Emacs version, you might want to consider customizing new settings, and settings whose meanings or default values have changed. To do this, use `M-x customize-changed` and specify a previous Emacs version number using the minibuffer. It creates a customization buffer which shows all the settings and groups whose definitions have been changed since the specified version, loading them if necessary.

If you change settings and then decide the change was a mistake, you can use two commands to revisit your changes. Use `M-x customize-saved` to customize settings that you have saved. Use `M-x customize-unsaved` to customize settings that you have set but not saved.

## 50.1.7 Custom Themes

Custom themes are collections of settings that can be enabled or disabled as a unit. You can use Custom themes to switch easily between various collections of settings, and to transfer such collections from one computer to another.

A Custom theme is stored as an Emacs Lisp source file. If the name of the Custom theme is `NAME`, the theme file is named `NAME-theme.el`. See "Creating Custom Themes", for the format of a theme file and how to make one.

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Creating-Custom-Themes.html

Type `M-x customize-themes` to switch to a buffer named *Custom Themes*, which lists the Custom themes that Emacs knows about.

By default, Emacs looks for theme files in two locations: the directory specified by the variable `custom-theme-directory` (which defaults to `~/.emacs.d/`), and a directory named `etc/themes` in your Emacs installation (see the variable `data-directory`).

The latter contains several Custom themes distributed with Emacs that customize Emacs's faces to fit various color schemes. Note, however, that Custom themes need not be restricted to this purpose; they can be used to customize variables too.

If you want Emacs to look for Custom themes in some other directory, add the directory to the list variable `custom-theme-load-path`. 

Its default value is `(custom-theme-directory t)`; here, the symbol `custom-theme-directory` has the special meaning of the value of the variable `custom-theme-directory`, while `t` stands for the built-in theme directory `etc/themes`. The themes listed in the *Custom Themes* buffer are those found in the directories specified by `custom-theme-load-path`.

In the *Custom Themes* buffer, you can activate the checkbox next to a Custom theme to enable or disable the theme for the current Emacs session. When a Custom theme is enabled, all of its settings (variables and faces) take effect in the Emacs session. To apply the choice of themes to future Emacs sessions, type C-x C-s (custom-theme-save) or use the '[Save Theme Settings]' button.

When you first enable a Custom theme, Emacs displays the contents of the theme file and asks if you really want to load it. Because loading a Custom theme can execute arbitrary Lisp code, you should only say yes if you know that the theme is safe; in that case, Emacs offers to remember in the future that the theme is safe (this is done by saving the theme file's SHA-256 hash to the variable `custom-safe-themes`; if you want to treat all themes as safe, change its value to `t`). Themes that come with Emacs (in the `etc/themes` directory) are exempt from this check, and are always *considered safe*.

Setting or saving Custom themes actually works by customizing the variable `custom-enabled-themes`. The value of this variable is a list of Custom theme names (as Lisp symbols, e.g. "tango"). 

Instead of using the *Custom Themes* buffer to set `custom-enabled-themes`, you can customize the variable using the usual customization interface, e.g., with `M-x customize-option`. Note that Custom themes are not allowed to set `custom-enabled-themes` themselves.

Any customizations that you make through the customization buffer take precedence over theme settings. This lets you easily override individual theme settings that you disagree with. 

If settings from two different themes overlap, the theme occurring earlier in `custom-enabled-themes` takes precedence. In the customization buffer, if a setting has been changed from its default by a Custom theme, its 'State' display shows 'THEMED' instead of 'STANDARD'.

You can enable a specific Custom theme in the current Emacs session by typing `M-x load-theme`. This prompts for a theme name, loads the theme from the theme file, and enables it.

If a theme file has been loaded before, you can enable the theme without loading its file by typing `M-x enable-theme`. 

To disable a Custom theme, type `M-x disable-theme`.

To see a description of a Custom theme, type `?` on its line in the *Custom Themes* buffer; or type `M-x describe-theme` anywhere in Emacs and enter the theme name.

Some themes have *variants* - most often just two: light and dark. 

You can switch to another variant using `M-x theme-choose-variant`. 

If the currently active theme has only one other variant, it will be selected; if there are more variants, the command will prompt you which one to switch to.

Note that `theme-choose-variant` only works if a single theme is active.


## 50.1.8 Creating Custom Themes

You can define a Custom theme using an interface similar to the customization buffer, by typing M-x customize-create-theme. This switches to a buffer named *Custom Theme*. It also offers to insert some common Emacs faces into the theme (a convenience, since Custom themes are often used to customize faces). If you answer no, the theme will initially contain no settings.

Near the top of the *Custom Theme* buffer, there are editable fields where you can enter the theme's name and description. The name can be anything except 'user'. The description is the one that will be shown when you invoke M-x describe-theme for the theme. Its first line should be a brief one-sentence summary; in the buffer made by M-x customize-themes, this sentence is displayed next to the theme name.

To add a new setting to the theme, use the '[Insert Additional Face]' or '[Insert Additional Variable]' buttons. Each button reads a face or variable name using the minibuffer, with completion, and inserts a customization entry for the face or variable. You can edit the variable values or face attributes in the same way as in a normal customization buffer. To remove a face or variable from the theme, uncheck the checkbox next to its name.

After specifying the Custom theme's faces and variables, type C-x C-s (custom-theme-write) or use the buffer's '[Save Theme]' button. This saves the theme file, named name-theme.el where name is the theme name, in the directory named by custom-theme-directory.

From the *Custom Theme* buffer, you can view and edit an existing Custom theme by activating the '[Visit Theme]' button and specifying the theme name. You can also add the settings of another theme into the buffer, using the '[Merge Theme]' button. You can import your non-theme settings into a Custom theme by using the '[Merge Theme]' button and specifying the special theme named 'user'.

A theme file is simply an Emacs Lisp source file, and loading the Custom theme works by loading the Lisp file. Therefore, you can edit a theme file directly instead of using the *Custom Theme* buffer. See Custom Themes in The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, for details.
