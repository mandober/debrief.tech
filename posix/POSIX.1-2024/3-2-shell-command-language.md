## 2.1 Shell Introduction

The *shell* is a command language interpreter.

This chapter describes the syntax of that command language as it is used by the `sh` utility and the system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024.

The shell operates according to the following general overview of operations (the specific details are included in the cited sections of this chapter):

- The shell reads its input
  - from a file
  - from the `-c` option
  - from the system() and popen() functions 
  If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the characters `#!`, the results are unspecified.

- The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators
  (see 2.3 Token Recognition)

- The shell parses the input into simple commands and compound commands.
  (see 2.9.1 Simple Commands and 2.9.4 Compound Commands)

- For each word within a command, the shell processes BACKSLASH-escape sequences inside dollar-single-quotes (see 2.2.4 Dollar-Single-Quotes) and then performs various word expansions (see 2.6 Word Expansions). In the case of a simple command, the results usually include a list of pathnames and fields to be treated as a command name and arguments (see 2.9 Shell Commands).

- The shell performs redirection (see 2.7 Redirection) and removes redirection operators and their operands from the parameter list.

- The shell executes a function (see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command), built-in (see 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities ), executable file, or script, giving the names of the arguments as positional parameters numbered 1 to n, and the name of the command (or in the case of a function within a script, the name of the script) as special parameter 0 (see 2.9.1.4 Command Search and Execution).

- The shell optionally waits for the command to complete and collects the exit status (see 2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands).
