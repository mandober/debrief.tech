# Terminal :: Terminal drawbacks

These terminal dejections generally pertain to the use of terminal emulators in text mode, in the console.

Command-line applications and screen-orientated programs that run in a terminal can run in the text only mode (console mode?) or under the auspices (from Latin 'auspicium', from auspex 'observer of birds', from avis 'bird' + specere 'to look') of X protocol in windowed mode (i.e. "under X").


When used in windowed mode, then the X protocol handles input processing so these drawbacks disappear.
