# History of human-to-computer interfaces

- Human-to-Computer Interface (HCI)
- Text Interface
- Command-line Interface (CLI)
- Text-based Interface (TUI)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Command-line interface** (CLI) is the ubiquitous way to interact with a computer that comes in the form of a command line where the user types in commands using the keyboard, and the computer interprets and executes those commands, displaying the resulting information on a monitor.

**Patch-cables** were initially used as the only possible means to input data into a computer. And the computer would convey the results via a set of lights.

**Punctured cardboards** were the next step in the HCI developement, used as means of inputing data. They were just pieces of cardboard paper, of standardized dimensions, where the holes represented zeros.

**Printing out output**: before the advent of monitors, the output from a computer was conveyed by printing it out.

**Keyboard and monitor**: modern way of interacting with computers almost always includes a *keyboard* for users to rely the input data to the computer, and a *monitor* (screen) for computer to rely the output to the user. Hand at heart, monitor is also participates in conveying the input since it helpfully echos the characters the user types in.

Other means of relying the input include peripherals like mouse, trackpad, trackball, plus a slew of specialied set of controls, mostly used in gaming, like joystick, wheels, etc. A microphone also belongs to devices used for input since it can be used to voice-control a computer.

On the other hand, observing the output has not much changed once monitors (and projectors) were introduced. There do exist devices for relying output, but these are used in special situations, like the machine that outputs *braille*. Monitors are likely to remain dominant until, perhaps, the advent of the *neural interface*.
