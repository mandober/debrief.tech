In the 1980s, there was a myriad of different, incompatible, character encoding schemes, all based on the extended ASCII charset.

mess of code pages based on the extended ASCII charset. The ASCII charset is 7-bit encoding capable of encoding 128 different characters. The 8th bit, the MSB bit, was left at zero.
