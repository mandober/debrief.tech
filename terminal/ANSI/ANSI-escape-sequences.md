**ANSI escape sequences** are a standard for *in-band signaling* to control


*ANSI codes* mean *ANSI escape sequences*, standardized as ANSI X3.64.


and other options on video text terminals and terminal emulators.

Certain *sequences of bytes*, most starting with an ASCII escape character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.

ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace *vendor-specific sequences* and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s.

Although terminals are extinct as hardware devices, they live on in the software, as *terminal emulator* programs, all which are modelled after real physical terminals, so they try to interpret the ANSI standard in the same way.
