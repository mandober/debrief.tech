# Shell

## Command interpreter

Shells we know today, with their rich features, have started far more humble, as *command interpreters*. There would be a list of available cammands on the system, and the user would type in the exact command name to execute it. There was no notion of types - although technically the user typed strings, no one thought to put command names in quotes. They were just words. Some, that matched the name of an existing command would cause it execute, and those that didn't would cause an error.

Shells were command interpreters for a long time before anyone thought they could be extended with programming language features.
