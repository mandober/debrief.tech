# Linux Standard Base

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/start

The Linux Standard Base (LSB) was created to lower the overall costs of supporting the Linux platform. By reducing the differences between individual Linux distributions, the LSB greatly reduces the costs involved with porting applications to different distributions, as well as lowers the cost and effort involved in after-market support of those applications.

## About LSB

When targeting Linux as a platform, application developers want to have some assurance that the code they write on one Linux distribution will run on other Linux distributions without having to go through extra effort. This matches their experiences on other popular platforms, such as Windows or Mac. In addition, application developers want to ensure that the platform as a whole does not diverge. Even if an application works on today's distributions, will it work on tomorrow's?

The LSB workgroup has, as its core goal, to address these two concerns. We publish a standard that describes the minimum set of APIs a distribution must support, in consultation with the major distribution vendors. We also provide tests and tools which measure support for the standard, and enable application developers to target the common set. Finally, through our testing work, we seek to prevent unnecessary divergence between the distributions.

Each specification and associated software deliverables is known as an LSB module. *LSB modules* are produced in a common format designed to integrate with each other and can be either required or optional.
* Required modules are those modules that meet the LSB acceptance criteria.
* Optional modules are those modules that do not yet meet the LSB acceptance criteria and represent additional features in development or under consideration for inclusion in a future version of the LSB standard.
