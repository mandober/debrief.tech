## Linux Distribution
https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/linux-distribution/

A Linux distribution, often shortened to Linux distro, is an operating system compiled from components developed by various open source projects and programmers. Each distribution includes the Linux kernel (the foundation of the operating system), the GNU shell utilities (the terminal interface and commands), the X server (for a graphical desktop), the desktop environment, a package management system, an installer and other services. Many components are developed independently from each other and are distributed in source code form. Distros also include an Internet browser, management tools and other software such as the KVM hypervisor. A single Linux distribution may contain thousands of software packages, utilities and applications.

Linux distributions compile code from open source projects and combine it into a single operating system that can be installed and booted up. Linux distributions are available for desktop computers, for servers without a graphical interface, for super computers, for mobile devices, and for special uses, such as home theater PCs and embedded systems. Because it is open source software, anyone can make their own Linux distribution by assembling it from the source code themselves, or by modifying an existing distribution. Currently, more than 300 Linux distributions are actively maintained.

There are commercially backed distributions, such as Fedora (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical Ltd.), and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready to use and pre-compiled for a specific instruction set, while some distributions are distributed mostly in source code form and compiled locally during installation. Some commercial distributions charge users a fee for support and customer development services. Open source licensing prohibits charging for open source software.


## What is a Linux distribution?

A Linux distribution, or distro, is an installable operating system centered around the Linux kernel, supporting user programs and libraries. Each vendor or community's version is a distro. Because the Linux operating system is open sourced and released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their modified code. These differ greatly from the traditional, proprietary, closed operating systems such as Unix, Windows, MacOS.

* What are the benefits of an enterprise distro?

If Linux is free and open source, why would you want to pay for a commercial distribution? Community distros are a great option for people who are new to Linux and don't have much experience with the command line, or who just want to play around and experiment. If you're trying to support a server for a long period of time, community distros like Fedora might not be the best choice.

Enterprise distros, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, are designed to meet business needs and concerns. Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers 10-year life cycle support (as opposed to Fedora's 2 years of support), so you can better support long-term apps. With an enterprise distro, you get patches, updates, upgrades, expert technical support, and access to training and resources. A community distro relies on forum-based support from its community members, and release cycles aren't always on a regular cadence.

Also with a commercially supported distro, you get the benefits of the latest open source innovation with the stability and support an enterprise needs. Red Hat has a team of engineers to help improve features, reliability, and security to make sure your infrastructure performs and remains stable-no matter your use case and workload.
