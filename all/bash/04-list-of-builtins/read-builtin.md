- Input mode may be interactive or piped (file, cmd output, string, etc.)
- Options that commonly go along with a particular mode:
* *Interactive* mode (I)
  - for accepting direct user input
  - to issue prompt, `-p 'Project name? '`
  - to set default text (as if just read): `-i '[proj42]'`
  - set input timeout (avoid AFK problem): `-t 5`
* *Piped* mode
  - for feeding in the contents of file, string, command output, etc.
  - may set input FD instead of stdin


- Reads chars into variable(s)
- Since bash 4.3-alpha, skips `NUL` (0) in input.

If <NAMEâ€¦> is given, the line is word-split using IFS variable, and every word is assigned to one <VNAME>. The remaining words are all assigned to the last <VNAME> if more words than variable names are present.
