# Word Splitting

The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, 
and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.

The shell treats each character in `IFS` as a delimiter, and splits the results 
of the other expansions into words using these characters as field terminators. 

* If IFS is unset, or its value is exactly <space><tab><newline>, the default, 
  then sequences of <space>, <tab>, and <newline> at the beginning and end of 
  the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of IFS 
  characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. 

* If IFS has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace 
  characters (spaces and tabs) are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, 
  as long as the whitespace character is in the value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character). 

* Any character in IFS that is not IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS 
  whitespace characters, delimits a field. 

* A sequence of IFS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. 

* If the value of IFS is null, no word splitting occurs.

* Explicit null arguments ("" or '') are retained.
 
* Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the 
  expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. 

* If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, 
  a null argument results and is retained.

Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.
