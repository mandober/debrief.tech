# Bash

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming use.

While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms.



## Basic Shell Features

Bash is an acronym for "Bourne-Again SHell".

The Bourne shell is the traditional Unix shell originally written by Stephen Bourne in 1971.

Bash has inherited all Bourne shell builtins. 

The evaluation and quoting rules are taken from the POSIX specs for the standards-compliant Unix shell.

This chapter briefly summarizes the shell's building blocks: commands, control structures, shell functions, shell parameters, shell expansions, redirections, which are a way to direct input and output from and to named files, and how the shell executes commands.

- Shell Syntax: What your input means to the shell
- Shell Commands: The types of commands you can use
- Shell Functions: Grouping commands by name
- Shell Parameters: How the shell stores values
- Shell Expansions: Parameters and other expansions
- Redirections: A way to control where input and output go
- Executing Commands: What happens when you run a command
- Shell Scripts: Executing files of shell commands
