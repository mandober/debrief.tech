# Glossary


## XSLT
is a language for transforming XML into some other format.

## XPath
language used to succinctly pinpoint exact XML nodes in a DOM.

## XQuery
is a superset of XPath that also provides FLWOR syntax, which is SQL-like. XQuery stands for XML Query Language. It is a language to select subsets and substructures from a large set of XML files. XPath is used a lot in XQuery.

## XPointer
is an extension of XPath to address nodes more accurately within XML fragments or even subparts of nodes. XPointer includes XPath, but also provides a simpler position-based addressing scheme.

## XLink
is a standard to define relationships.

## XInclude
is a standard to compose multiple pieces of XML into one using for instance XLink relationships.

## XProc
is a standard with which can be described how XML documents should be processed to get to a desired end result. It is expressed itself in XML, and describes the process step by step, also called XML Pipelines. Within XProc you use e.g. XQuery, XSLT, and XInclude languages (and thus indirectly XPath, XPointer and XLink as well) to express what needs to be done exactly within each step.


## SoapUI
open-source tool used for functional and non-functional testing, widely used in *WebServices testing*.

## SOA
**Service-oriented architecture** (SOA) is a style of *software design* where *services* are provided over a network. Its basic principles are independent of vendors, products and tech. SOA is modular as different services can be combined to produce the final app. SOA integrates *distributed*, *separately-maintained* and *separately-deployed* **software components**. A **service** is a *discrete unit of functionality* that can be accessed remotely and consumed independently (e.g. retrieving a credit card statement online). Service can be combined to comprise software components of a larger web app. A service in *SOA* is distiguished by these properties: it logically represents an *activity with a defined result*, it is *self-contained*, it is a *black box* for its consumers, it may consist of other underlying services.

## CORBA
**Common Object Request Broker Architecture** (CORBA) is a standard designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on different platforms, enabling collaboration between systems, independent of platforms and programming languages. CORBA uses OO model and distributed object paradigm.
