exec

exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]

If command is specified, it replaces the shell.
No new process is created.
The arguments become the arguments to command. 

-l the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument passed to command. This is what login does. 
-c option causes command to be executed with an empty environment. 
-a the shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the executed command. 

* If command cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, 
  unless the execfail shell option is enabled. In that case, it returns failure. 
* An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed. 
* If command is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0. 
* If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.
