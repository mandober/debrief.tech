shopt [-opq] [s|u] [optname ...]

Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell behavior. 

s and u are the only mutually exclusive options:
-s   set (enable) each optname. 
-u   unset (disable) each optname.

all these can be combined:
-q   	be quiet, suppresses normal output; the return status indicates whether the optname is set or unset. 
	If multiple optname arguments are given with -q, return status is zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise.
-p   	print output in reusable format
-o   	Restricts the values of optname to be those defined with set -o option
--	shopt by itself lists all settable options with an indication of whether or not each is set, in a human friendly format.
	set -p, set -po, set -pos, set -pou ...

* Unless otherwise noted, the shopt options are disabled (unset) by default.
* BASHOPTS - colon-separated list of enabled shopt options (BASHOPTS=cdspell:cmdhist:...)

RETURN STATUS
* when listing options, it is zero if all optnames are enabled, non-zero otherwise. 
* when setting or unsetting options, it is zero unless an optname is not a valid shell option.

The list of shopt options is:


history

histappend
If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of 
the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.

histreedit
If set, and readline is being used, a user is given the 
opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.

histverify
If set, and readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not 
immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded 
into the readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.

lithist 
If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the 
history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.

cmdhist 
If set, bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the 
same history entry. This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.



dir

autocd 
If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were 
the argument to the cd command. This option is only used by interactive shells.

cdable_vars
If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is 
assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.

cdspell 
If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected. 
The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and one character too many. 
If a correction is found, the corrected filename is printed, and the command proceeds. 
This option is only used by interactive shells.


completion

progcomp
If set, the programmable completion facilities are enabled. This option is enabled by default.

dirspell
If set, bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word 
completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.

direxpand
If set, bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion. 
This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer. If not set, bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.

no_empty_cmd_completion
If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to search the PATH 
for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.

complete_fullquote
If set, bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion.
If not set, bash removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign from the set of characters that will be 
quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to 
be completed. This means that dollar signs in variable names that expand to directories will not be quoted; 
however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either. 
This is active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames. 
This variable is set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2.

force_fignore
If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored 
when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions. 
This option is enabled by default.

hostcomplete
If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform hostname completion 
when a word containing a @ is being completed (see Completing under READLINE above). 
This is enabled by default.

completion_strip_exe
Strip .exe when completing executables (Cygwin).


GLOBBING

dotglob 
If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion.

extglob 
If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under Pathname Expansion are enabled.

failglob
If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an expansion error.

globasciiranges
If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see Pattern Matching above)
behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.  That is, the current locale's 
collating sequence is not taken into account, so b will not collate between A and B, and upper-case 
and lower-case ASCII characters will collate together.

globstar
If set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more 
directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a /, only directories and subdirectories match.

nocaseglob
If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion.

nullglob
If set, bash allows patterns which match no files to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.


debugging

extdebug
If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
1. declare -F displays the source file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
2. If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not executed.
3. If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine 
   (a shell function or a shell script executed by the . or source builtins), a call to return is simulated.
4. BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions above.
5. Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and 
   subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
6. Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and 
   subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the ERR trap.

inherit_errexit
a new `shopt' option that, when set, causes command substitutions to inherit the -e option.
By default, those subshells disable -e.  It's enabled as part of turning on posix mode.

gnu_errfmt
If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.

shift_verbose
If set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.




OTHER

checkhash
If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to 
execute it. If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.

checkwinsize
If set, bash checks the window size after each command and, 
if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS. 

execfail
If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an 
argument to the exec builtin command. An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.

expand_aliases
If set, aliases are expanded as described above under ALIASES. 
This option is enabled by default for interactive shells and disabled for non-interactive shells.
Changing this option will enable alias support for non-interactive shells.

extquote
If set, $'string' and $"string" quoting is performed. within ${parameter} 
expansions enclosed in double quotes. This option is enabled by default.

huponexit
If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

interactive_comments
If set, allow a word beginning with # to cause that word and all remaining characters on that line 
to be ignored in an interactive shell (see COMMENTS above). This option is enabled by default.

lastpipe
If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a 
pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment.

login_shell
The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell. The value may not be changed.

mailwarn
If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last 
time it was checked, the message ``The mail in mailfile has been read'' is displayed.

nocasematch
If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when 
performing matching while executing case or [[ conditional commands.

promptvars
If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, 
and quote removal after being expanded as described in PROMPTING above. This option is enabled by default.

sourcepath
If set, the source (.) builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory containing 
the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default.

xpg_echo
If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.





jobs

checkjobs
If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell. 
If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without 
an intervening command (see JOB CONTROL above). The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.



compatibility

restricted_shell
The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode. The value may not be changed. 
This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing the startup files to 
discover whether or not a shell is restricted.

compat31
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.1 with respect to quoted arguments to 
the [[ conditional command's =~ operator and locale-specific string comparison when using 
the [[ conditional command's < and > operators. Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII
collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation sequence and strcoll(3).

compat32
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.2 with respect to locale-specific 
string comparison when using the [[ conditional command's < and > operators (see previous item).

compat40
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 4.0 with respect to locale-specific string 
comparison when using the [[ conditional command's < and > operators (see description of compat31) 
and the effect of interrupting a command list. Bash versions 4.0 and later interrupt the list as if 
the shell received the interrupt; previous versions continue with the next command in the list.

compat41
If set, bash, when in posix mode, treats a single quote in a double-quoted parameter expansion as 
a special character. The single quotes must match (an even number) and the characters between the 
single quotes are considered quoted. This is the behavior of posix mode through version 4.1. 
The default bash behavior remains as in previous versions.

compat42
If set, bash does not process the replacement string in 
the pattern substitution word expansion using quote removal.

compat43
