# History Word Designators

Word designators are used to select desired words from the event. A : separates the event specification from the word designator. It may be omitted if
the word designator begins with a ^, $, *, -, or %. Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).
Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.

0 	The zeroth word. For the shell, this is the command word.
n   	The nth word.
^   	The first argument. That is, word 1.
$   	The last word. This is usually the last argument, but will expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
%   	The word matched by the most recent `?string?' search.
x-y  	A range of words; `-y' abbreviates `0-y'.
*   	All of the words but the zeroth. This is a synonym for `1-$'. It is not an error to use * if there is just one word in the event; 
	the empty string is returned in that case.
x*   	Abbreviates x-$.
x-   	Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.

If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event.
