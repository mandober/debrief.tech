### 8.3.3 Sample Init File



Here is an example of an INPUTRC file. This illustrates key binding,
variable assignment, and conditional syntax.

```bash
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for
# programs that use the GNU Readline library. Existing
# programs include FTP, Bash, and GDB.
#
# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
# assignments from /etc/Inputrc
$include /etc/Inputrc

# Set various bindings for emacs mode.
set editing-mode emacs

$if mode=emacs
