# 8.1 Introduction to Line Editing

The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent keystrokes.

The text `C-k` is read as `Control-K` and describes the character produced when the <k> key is pressed while the Control key is depressed.

The text `M-k` is read as `Meta-K` and describes the character produced when the Meta key is depressed, and the <k> key is pressed. The Meta key is labeled <ALT> on many keyboards. On keyboards with two keys labeled <ALT> (usually to either side of the space bar), the <ALT> on the left side is generally set to work as a Meta key. The <ALT> key on the right may also be configured to work as a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a Compose key for typing accented characters. If you do not have a Meta or <ALT> key, or another key working as a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <ESC> first, and then typing <k>. Either process is known as **metafying** the <k> key.

The text `M-C-k` is read as `Meta-Control-k` and describes the character produced by "metafying" `C-k`.

- `\M-\C-k` = M-C-k
- `\e\C-k` = M-C-k

In addition, several keys have their own names: <DEL>, <ESC>, <LFD>, <SPC>, <RET>, <TAB> all stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file. If your keyboard lacks a <LFD> key, typing <C-j> will produce the desired character. The <RET> key may be labeled <Return> or <Enter> on some keyboards.
