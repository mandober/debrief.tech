# New in bash v.4.4 compared to bash v.4.3


config
There is now a settable configuration #define that will cause the shell
to exit if the shell is running setuid without the -p option and setuid to the real uid fails.
The default value for the `checkhash' shell option may now be set at compile time with a #define.
There is a new `--enable-function-import' configuration option to allow
importing shell functions from the environment; import is enabled by default.
`make install' now installs the example loadable builtins and a set of bash headers to use when developing new loadable builtins.
There is a new option settable in config-top.h that makes multiple directory arguments to `cd' a fatal error.
The maximum number of nested recursive calls to `eval' is now settable in config-top.h; the default is no limit.
The maximum number of nested recursive calls to `source' is now settable in config-top.h; the default is no limit.

builtins
option '-p' to declare and similar builtins displays attributes for vars even when those vars have not been assigned values (so technically unset).
declare no longer displays arrays using compound assignment syntax with quotes; that will generate warnings when re-used as input
Bash no longer attempts to perform compound assignment if a var on RHS of assignment statement arg to `declare' has the form of compound assignment (e.g. w='(word)'; declare foo=$w). compound assignments are accepted if var was already declared as an array, but with a warning.
local takes a new arg: `local -`, which cause it to save single-letter shell options and restore their previous values at function return.
mapfile has -d option to use arbitrary character as record delimiter, and -t option to strip the delimiter as supplied with -d.
ulimit has new -k (kqueues) and -P (pseudoterminals) options.
printf -v var "" will now set var to the empty string, as if var="" had been executed.
complete and compgen have a new -o nosort option, which forces readline to not sort the completion matches.
unset now unsets a scalar variable if it is subscripted with a `0', analogous to the ${var[0]} expansion.
kill builtin now has a `-L' option, equivalent to `-l', for compatibility with Linux standalone versions of kill.
`enable -f` now attempts to call functions named BUILTIN_builtin_load when loading BUILTIN, and BUILTIN_builtin_unload when deleting it.
This allows loadable builtins to run initialization and cleanup code.
All builtin commands recognize the `--help' option and print a usage summary.

vars
New variable: EXECIGNORE; a colon-separate list of patterns that will cause matching filenames to be ignored when searching for commands.
BASH_LOADABLES_PATH containing a list of directories where the `enable -f' command looks for shared objects containing loadable builtins.
BASH_SUBSHELL is updated for process substitution and group commands in pipelines, and available with the same value when running any exit trap.
Bash checks $INSIDE_EMACS as well as $EMACS when deciding whether or not bash is being run in a GNU Emacs shell window.
BASH_COMPAT and FUNCNEST can be inherited and set from the shell's initial environment.
OLDPWD can be inherited from the environment if it names a directory.
New prompt string: PS0. Expanded and displayed by interactive shells after reading a complete command but before executing it.

shell options
`set -i` is no longer valid, as in other shells.
pattern substitution word expansion, GLOBIGNORE and programmable completion match filtering now honor the value of the 'nocasematch' option.
Command and process substitutions now turn off the `set -v' option when executing, as other shells seem to do.
complete_fullquote option changes filename completion to quote all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names.
inherit_errexit: a new `shopt' option that, when set, causes command substitutions to inherit the -e option.
By default, those subshells disable -e.  It's enabled as part of turning on posix mode.
If executing implicit `cd' when the `autocd` option is set, bash will now invoke a function named `cd` if exists before executing `cd' builtin.

syntax
Bash does not allow function names containing `/' and `=' to be exported.
Bash now uses mktemp() when creating internal temporary files; it produces a warning at build time on many Linux systems.
The shell now allows `time; othercommand' to time null commands.
Posix-mode shells now allow double quotes to quote the history expansion character.
Executing the RHS of && and || will no longer cause the shell to fork if it's not necessary.
Shells running as root no longer inherit PS4, closing a security hole involving PS4 expansion performing command substitution.
There is a new ${parameter@spec} family of operators to transform the value of `parameter'.
Bash now allows waiting for the most recent process substitution, since it appears as $!.
Bash now treats SIGINT received when running a non-builtin command in a loop the way it has traditionally
treated running a builtin command: running any trap handler and breaking out of the loop.
Aliases whose value ends in a shell metacharacter now expand in a way to allow them to be `pasted' to the next token, 
which can potentially change the meaning of a command (e.g., turning `&' into `&&').
Interactive shells now behave as if SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/SIGTTOU are set to SIG_DFL when the shell is started, 
so they are set to SIG_DFL in child processes.
Value conversions (arithmetic expansions, case modification, etc.) now happen when assigning elements of an array using compound assignment.





New Features in Readline

history
history truncation code now uses the same error recovery mechansim as the history writing code, and restores 
the old version of the history file on error. The error recovery mechanism handles symlinked history files.
If readline reads a history file that begins with `#' (or the value of the history comment character) and has enabled 
history timestamps, the history entries are assumed to be delimited by timestamps. This allows multi-line history entries.
The :p history modifier now applies to the entire line, so any expansion specifying :p causes the line to be printed instead of expanded.

variables
new bindable variable, enable-bracketed-paste, which enables support for a terminal's bracketed paste mode.
new bindable variable, colored-completion-prefix, which causes common prefix of a set of possible completions to be displayed in color.
new bindable command vi-yank-pop, a vi-mode version of emacs- mode yank-pop.

prompt
The editing mode indicators can now be strings and are user-settable (new `emacs-mode-string', `vi-cmd-mode-string' and `vi-ins-mode-string' variables). Mode strings can contain invisible character sequences. Setting mode strings to null strings restores the defaults.
Prompt expansion adds the mode string to the last line of a multi-line prompt (one with embedded newlines).

bindings
Readline now throws an error if it parses a key binding without a terminating `:' or whitespace.
The default binding for ^W in vi mode now uses word boundaries specified by Posix (vi-unix-word-rubout is bindable command name).

misc
The redisplay code underwent several efficiency improvements for multibyte locales.
The insert-char function attempts to batch-insert all pending typeahead that maps to self-insert, as long as it is coming from the terminal.
If an incremental search string has its last character removed with DEL, the resulting empty search string no longer matches the previous line.
Handle >| and strings of digits preceding and following redirection specifications as single tokens when tokenizing the line for history expansion.
Fixed a bug with displaying completions when the prefix display length is greater than the length of the completions to be displayed.
rl_callback_sigcleanup new app function that can clean up and unset any state set by readline's callback mode. Intended for use after a signal.
rl_clear_visible_line new app-callable function; clears all screen lines occupied by the current visible readline line.
rl_tty_set_echoing app-callable function that controls whether or not readline thinks it is echoing terminal output.
rl_pending_signal new app-callable function: returns the signal number of any signal readline has caught but not yet handled.
rl_persistent_signal_handlers new app-settable variable: if set to a non-zero value, readline will enable the readline-6.2 signal handler behavior in callback mode: handlers are installed when rl_callback_handler_install is called and removed removed when a complete line has been read.
