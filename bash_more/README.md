# Bash

But the evil that once wasâ€¦ has reemerged.

In the year 2525 if a man is still alive: "The code you have in your example script uses a redirection construct specific to bash, mkey? It is therefore not portable, mkey?" (gasp!) "Please use `>file 2>&1` for maximum portability, mkey?". We don't wanna discomfortabulate the VT520 users, do we now? "And please don't hardcode escapes sequences, it's not portable, mkey? Please use tput instead for maximum portability, mkey?". Maximum diversity, maximum effort.
