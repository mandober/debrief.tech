# 3.2.0 Shell Commands

https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Commands.html

A simple shell command (e.g. "echo a b c") consists of the command itself (echo) followed by the arguments, separated by spaces.

More complex shell commands are composed of simple commands arranged together in a variety of ways: in a pipeline in which the output of one command becomes the input of a second, in a loop or conditional construct, or in some other grouping.

- Reserved Words:    Words that have special meaning to the shell.
- Simple Commands:   The most common type of command.
- Pipelines:         Connecting the input and output of several commands.
- Lists:             How to execute commands sequentially.
- Compound Commands: Shell commands for control flow.
- Coprocesses:       Two-way communication between commands.
- GNU Parallel:      Running commands in parallel.
