# Bash :: Concepts

Bash features (`bash-features` section) are the standard facilities and faculties that come with the bash shell, as opposed to the user-created extra or augmented functionality built on top of it. Although the line between the two is blurry, artificial even, the later are placed in the `bash-concepts` section to aid easier classification and more comfortable browsing.
