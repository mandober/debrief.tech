# Index :: Shell Metacharacters




Shell metacharacters

Metacharacters are the individual characters, with special meaning to the shell, that make up names of *shell operators*, either alone (as a single character), or in combination with one or more meta- and/or ordinary characters.

In fact, all the metacharacters listed below are valid shell operators by themselves; that is, except parenthesis, which are always balanced, and usually used to surround other shell words (for forcing a subshell, `$(…)`, forcing precedence, etc.).

A **shell operator** is a command internal to the shell, with a name that consists of at least one metacharcter, with additional characters being other metacharcters or ordinary characters.
