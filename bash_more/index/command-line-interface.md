# Command-line interface

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface

A **command-line interface** (CLI) is the most basic type of human-computer interface (HCI) having the form of a simple, text-only command line, which the users use to issue commands to the computer and the computer uses for displaying output and feedback.

CLI is used by a *command-line interpreter* or *command-line processor* as a means to receive commands from a user. This provides a means of setting parameters for the environment, invoking executables, providing information as to what actions they are to perform.

In some cases the invocation is conditional based on conditions established by the user or previous executables. Such access was first provided by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s. This provided an *interactive environment* not available with punched cards or other input methods.

Today, many users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions. However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and use a command line.

Alternatives to the command-line interface include text-based user interface menus (for example, IBM AIX SMIT), keyboard shortcuts, and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer (usually controlled with a mouse). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, DOS Shell, and Mouse Systems PowerPanel.

Command-line interfaces are often implemented in *terminal devices* that are also capable of *screen-oriented* *text-based* *user interfaces* that use *cursor addressing* to place symbols on a *display screen*.

Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.

Many software systems implement command-line interfaces for control and operation. This includes programming environments and utility programs.
