## Environment variables

Some parameters that are automatically set have different origins:
- (possibly) set or inherited from the OS, the program that invoked the shell, or set by the terminal
- some env (shell) vars are almost certainly set by the shell
- ther eis a set of bash vars set by bash (especially, `BASH*`)
- startup scripts: system and current-user scripts
- custom scripts: by admin or user
- triggered (by cron, service)


Variables found in an avergae bash session come in two major flavors:
- *shell variables*
- *bash variables*
