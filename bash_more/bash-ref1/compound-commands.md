#### 3.2.5 Compound Commands

Compound commands are the shell programming language constructs. Each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator. Any redirections (see [Redirections][1]) associated with a compound command apply to all commands within that compound command unless explicitly overridden.

In most cases a list of commands in a compound commandâ€™s description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon.

Bash provides looping constructs, conditional commands, and mechanisms to group commands and execute them as a unit.
