Shell Commands (Bash Reference Manual)
A simple shell command such as `echo a b c` consists of the command itself followed by arguments, separated by spaces.

More complex shell commands are composed of simple commands arranged together in a variety of ways: in a pipeline in which the output of one command becomes the input of a second, in a loop or conditional construct, or in some other grouping.

• [Reserved Words][1]  Words that have special meaning to the shell. • [Simple Commands][2]  The most common type of command. • [Pipelines][3]  Connecting the input and output of several commands. • [Lists][4]  How to execute commands sequentially. • [Compound Commands][5]  Shell commands for control flow. • [Coprocesses][6]  Two-way communication between commands. • [GNU Parallel][7]  Running commands in parallel.
