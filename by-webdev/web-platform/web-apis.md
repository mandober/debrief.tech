# Web APIs

The traditional and most common hosting environment to embed JavaScript are browsers and JS makes no significant effort to clearly demarcate when it stops and the environment begins. Namely, the hosting environment can provide as little or as much of additional functionality as it wants. JS has for so long been tied to browsers that we tend to think of all that functionality as being the JavaScript language. But the fact is that there is a JavaScript language and there is a lot of additional functionality that a particular browser provides. That extra functionality goes under the name Web API.

A large number of Web APIs is available to developers for web programming. These APIs may be roughly classified as WebAPIs and Web interfaces, and they include numerous additional functionalities such as DOM, CSSOM, Clipboard API, History API, Page Visibility API, Geolocation API, along with functions like `alert` `setTimeout`, `prompt`.
